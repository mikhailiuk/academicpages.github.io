I am a researcher at the Rainbow group, Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge. My current research is focused on applications 
of Machine Learning to a problem of efficient data collection and modeling human visual system. I am particularly
interested in Deep Learning and Bayesian Inference. However my general interest is 
not constrained by these.

I have completed my PhD in 2020, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/">Dr. Rafal Mantiuk</a> at the Computer Science Department, Cambridge. Before joining Computer Lab I did an MPhil in Scientific Computing at Cambridge. During this time I was working under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=OTpMFDgAAAAJ">Dr. Anita Faul</a> on the dissertation entitled &#8220;Deep Learning and Parallelisation Applied to Seismic Data&#8221;. Before joining Cambridge I did a BEng in Computer Science and Electronics at the University of Bristol.
